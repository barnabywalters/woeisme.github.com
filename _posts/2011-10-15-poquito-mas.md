Well I'm long overdue for a post don't you think? I've hesitated updating recently because I was working on a small bash script to automate some of the posting annoyances of using jekyll. Specifically having to have all postings follow the format `date +%Y-%m-%d-"title".markdown (or .md). You also need to include a header of:

>--- 
>layout: blah
>title: blah
>---

then after that is all the git magic which I'm just starting to get the hang of.Anyhow I've got the preliminary script put together and it's in my [github](https://github.com/woeisme/woeisme.github.com) under post_creator.sh if you're curious. I think it's mostly failing because I'm trying to run it under git bash on win7. At some point I'm calling vi on the touched file and it's complaining about wrong slash created files. At a certain point I'm no longer interested in the distraction of finding shortcuts to do work and just want the work done. There should probably be a term for that. So tonight we've got our [radio show](www.freesoftwareroundtable.org) over at [Stonybrook campus](www.wusb.fm). We discuss free software culture, projects, law and any grey area in between. It's been going on a few years now and I'm still not sure if we have any REAL listeners, but we keep plugging away. It's strange how almost all projects start with a series of small almost miniscule steps. I guess that applies here as well.
