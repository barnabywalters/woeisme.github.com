So this is a bit stupid I guess. The radio show went fine and dandy even though we needed to do some fundraising plugs because it's radiothon.
I finally fixed up that posting [script](https://github.com/woeisme/woeisme.github.com/blob/gh-pages/post_creater.sh) I mentioned in an earlier post.
Someone recently showed me that you can edit directly through github's dashboard. Frankly this makes it a lot easier to post than my usual routine, only problem
it doesn't allow you to **create** files. So for now my solution has been to run that post create script, push it up, then create the actual posting on the dashboard.
This is obviously not a real solution, but each day that goes by is another step forward so hopefully I'll hit upon a better solution soon. 
Today I slept something like 15 hours straight which is not exactly an encouraging sign, then again the gf and I's halloween masks are coming along quite nicely so *something* was accomplished at least.
Still on the list of things to fix here, getting a better looking theme and figuring out how to push out posts more than once a day.
