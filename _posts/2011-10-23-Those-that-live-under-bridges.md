Last night I watched the excellent [Troll Hunter](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1740707/) on netflix. It was great, beautiful
shots of Norway interspersed with an interesting original storyline and some good hold your breath moments. I'm mentally gearing
up for my trip to Japan next month, as long as everything goes ok. I'm going to travel as light as possible and live out of a backpack. Hopefully I'll be able to take
some photo's and keep updating this. Perhaps I'll even have a reason to create a pics directory on github.
