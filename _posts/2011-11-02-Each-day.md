title: Each day
---

So I find myself in San Francisco atm, that was sudden hey? It was an interesting long flight over, briefly stopping in Chicago. As usual I met some 
interesting folk en plane and got some interesting advice. Right now what's worrying me is if I've packed enough and why my hip is bothering me,
 I'm assuming it's either from flying or walking, we'll see if it goes away. I'm doing the hostel thing and it's pretty much what you'd expect, a bunch of young kids living out of backpacks and rail thin speaking a multitude of languages. I also hadn't even realized that SF had a subway system!
Today however I think I need a small day pack, so thats the short term mission, long term I need to find something to DO. I'm pretty sure the latter will fix itself. I'm going to be a bit dishonest and create a post I intended to create the other day but never got around to. Unlinear postingt format like WOAH! anyhow look for it.
