So another new day finds me sitting in Tokyo. Neat huh? I'm getting a bit exhausted from the combinatino of the flight and weird sleep schedule adjustment,
however I felt the need to update this. I spent about 5 days in San Francisco walking around, chatting with other travellers and taking it easy. Eating a lot of Mexican food was also involved. San Fran is pretty ripe, everyone pours into the streets and strolls around quite easily. I feel like I have a good plan of what to do when I return and how best to spend my time. Since we arrived in Tokyo at around 11pm we didn't really get to see much yet except some of the monorail/subway system and the streets after dark. You notice immediately how clean the streets are, almost like they've been freshly mopped with hot water. Not many people were out an about when we took a stroll, mostly just stragglers and couples returning from bars it seemed. 
I'm looking forward to getting a feel for the city tomorrow, possibily heading to [Akihabara](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akihabara) to check out all the neat junk available. Unfortunately I won't be able to bring back anything with me since I packed so lightly, it will be very bittersweet. I'm pretty damn excited......and exhausted.
