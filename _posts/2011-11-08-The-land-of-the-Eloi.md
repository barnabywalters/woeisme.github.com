title: The land of the Eloi

So the second day in Tokyo was spent in a variety of strange explorations. 
We took up the Hostels offer of an "all you can eat" breakfast next door, only to discover that the only food was soup, toast, tea and coffee. 
Needless to say it pissed some members of our party off.
After this we had a brief adventure trying to change dollars into yen. 
This involved a trip to the local bank here, and about 20 minutes of beauracratic form filling and bowing. 
Two friends changed money while I just sat and observered the bank atmosphere. 
It consisted of 2 managers in suits and 3 security guards standing angled to the entrance. 
Every time someone would enter they would bow and say "irasshaimase"(entering) "arigato gohzaimas"(leaving). 
This in itself was not unusual, what is however was the frequency that this happened, perhaps once or twice every minute. It was almost constant. 
It was fascinating and horrifying at the same time. 
Nearly every store you enter will mimic this basic behavior ad infininium, I even witnessed to employees getting into a mock "irasshaimase" shouting match of sorts. 
This took place later as we attempted to buy pre-paid cellphones, what a fiasco! 
So apparently purchasing cell phones for foreigners (us) is a very difficult and expensive process, in the end only a few of us decided it was worth the hassle. 
We'd also met up a friend from [Make Tokyo](http://jp.makezine.com/) and he'd given us some of his insights from living in the country the last nine years. 
Apparently traveling without your passport on your person is crime in Japan for foreigners, and once you're arrested for something you're almost guaranteed to be convicted. 
All this seems to contribute to an amazingly low crime rate in Japan. 
Things that come as second habit when travelling, being aware of your possessions, watching your wallet, not leaving things unguarded or alone, are not really necessary here. 
It's a strange idea to get used to. That being said the overall societal effect is VERY noticable, I've recently compared it to friends that walking amongst the japanese seems akin to being amongst the [Eloi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eloi) there's just no guardedness. 
Frankly it's a little creepy.
