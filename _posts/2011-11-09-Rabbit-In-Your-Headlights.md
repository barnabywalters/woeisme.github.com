title: Rabbit In Your Headlights

So today is my third day in Japan, Tokyo specifically. Little observances are starting to accumulate in my mind now, small differences that might pass unnoticeed
unless you were looking for them. The first one I may have discussed already is the lack of crime, or even awareness of the possibility of crime. Once you get 
used to it there's a slight crack into Japanese culture that allows you to imagine what being a citizen is like. Orderliness and cleanliness are the next significant changes you become aware of. Often I walk down busy streets here and it looks like street crew was <i>just</i> having just turned the corner ahead of me. I saw a piece of trash today not in a recepticle, literally my first piece of trash I've seen in three days, and I'm almost certain if I return that way it will be gone by now. Both of these things juxtapose to form an interesting question. What does a society that is safe, clean and well organize DO all the time? Thats the question I'm still asking myself as I walk around and what earlier drew my perhaps cruel label of "Eloi". Honestly however it's the closest I can get to describing this phenomenon so far. It may just be my usual cynicism coming into play. I've seen some amazing infrastructure engineering here from the scale of the skyscrapers to the intracacies of the transit system that may not even be possible in other countries who have to spend every extra dollar fixing the things this society seems to have solved. Why then is a part of me convinces that there's a trade-off somehow? That without crime or the possibility of crime that there cannot be true danger nor true risk? Or that while cleanliness is desired by all it also limits the possibility of art to mere antisceptic imitation. Hopefully more understanding will come next posting interval.
