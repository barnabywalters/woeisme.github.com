Well it's been a while, probably not but it feels like it. We've been filling our days quick trips to various Tokyo locations. Today finds us at the [tokyo hackerspace](http://tokyohackerspace.org) for a BBQ.
Last night was spent drunkenly wandering through [Shinjuku](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinjuku,_Tokyo) and a quick pass through [The Golden Gai](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Gai) which was really unique and special. A good amount of drinking was done and each evening ends with us crammed on the last train back to ikebukuro cheek to jowl with other revelers. I'm beginning to see the constraints of a gaijin living in Japan.
It's an important lesson to learn for anyone non-native and cuts across the grain of our inherent thinking. I think as Americans we feel like every obstacle can be overcome with enough time and discipline. This doesn't float in Japan, people are born and there are certain obligations on them and there's only so much social mobility. As a gaijin, you could speak perfect japanese, be married to a japanese native even have kids born here but you will still be gaijin. Accepting this and getting over it is the quickest way to start enjoying japan. The future holds a trip to Osaka and possibly Hokkaido. Time is passing quickly and I hope we'll have time to see everything.
