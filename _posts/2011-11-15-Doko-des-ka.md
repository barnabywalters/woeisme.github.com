So hello! greetings from [Kyoto](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyoto) the beautiful city of the old kingdom. We took the [shinkansen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinkansen) today.
What a rush! It was everything I thought it would be and more! Imagine cruising along at 241 km/h (150 mph) banking during each turn and having this lush hilly territory flying by! The comfort and seating is similiar to an airplane or american amtrack train but the experience is solely japanese.
I'm not even sure something like this could be possible in the US. I'm very psyched that we'll have more opportunities to travel this way in the coming days but also sad as it marks the halfway point in my trip and eventual return home. Japan is so vast, and Kyoto contrasts against Tokyo markedly. Tokyo is metropolitan and bustling, Kyoto is crisp and homey, with small dark corridors and loping streets. The buildings that line Kyoto's streets are mostly made of wood and the highest point in the entire city is the [Kyoto Tower](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyoto_Tower). The rest of the city is slightly hilly and low dotted by large numbers of shrines and temples. The people seem more leisurely and friendly, stopping to wave or bow in acknowledgement when you pass. Overall I like it a lot more, it reminds me of the difference between Boston and New York City. This is not an entirely unbiased comparison as Boston is sister cities with Kyoto. Tomorrow is the Imperial palace and possibly Osaka. I'm looking forward to it.
