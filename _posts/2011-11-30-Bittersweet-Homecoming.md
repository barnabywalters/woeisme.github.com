So after a series of adventures, delays and choices I'm sitting in San Francisco Intl airport waiting for a plane to new york. I got "randomely" stopped by security both in Tokyo and arriving in LAX. 
While I was anticipating a huge pain in the ass it went rather quickly and I was done with mininal questioning / harassment in about 15 minutes. While relieved, I'm not glad. It doesn't make it any less repugnant. Nor do opting out each time for the body scanners when I'm flying. The procedures are definitely oriented to desensitizing as many flyers as possibly to rejecting them. I was suprised in LAX to find that I almost walked right into the scanner before realizing where I was. Any mention of "preferring not to" or "opting out" shunts you to the side to wait for a frisker to come and grab your junk and butt. Of course these are all subtle inducements to not cause waves in the security queue which when combined with most peoples innate nervousness with travel in general creates a perfect mode of control. 
It's really very Orwellian in design combining all the key elements of fear, public shaming, futility and stress. Pisses me off. I do enjoy flying in some respects. Most of the time I chat away happily to the hapless victims sitting next to me. I enjoy just meeting people who are traveling around. Now if only I could be sure about the girl being at the airport on time to pick me up!
