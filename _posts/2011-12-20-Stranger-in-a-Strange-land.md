title: Stranger in a Strange land
---

Well here it is, almost 3 weeks after I've returned and it still seems strange. For a period of time I was waking up and confused about which country I was in.
That has slowly faded but the feeling of still being a visitor in what most would consider my "home" has not yet. I'm not sure it will. I seem to 
be happiest when traveling in general. Even when I don't have a destination in mind it's very easy to prioritize goals and get this accomplished. Perhaps it's mostly due to the nature of the tasks associated with traveling. There's been so much other stuff going on here, this is the first time I've managed to come up for air.
Additionally the annual consumer holiday is here in full force, people rushing around spending money they probably don't have in a frantic effort demostrate how "in the spirit" they are. I guess you can tell I'm not a big fan. I like portions of it but another part of me thinks the whole thing is overblown and hypocritical. The part I do approve of is massive amounts of delicious food!
No status updates on a work visa and when that situation will update, for now I've started applying locally and in San Fran. At the very least maybe someone will fly me out for an interview. Till later.
