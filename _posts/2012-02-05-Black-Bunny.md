So for those who haven't been paying attention, I now live in Iceland. Suprising yes, but it's been in the work for a while. It's taken my brain a few days to really accept the fact that I'm completely uprooted and in a different country and I'm enjoying watching it squirm. ......which is a strange statement if you think about it. So expect much more information about new experiences in a strange strange land. For now however you're going to have to content yourself with a picture of a <a href="images/IMAG0322.jpg" rel="lightbox" title="lil bunny">bunny</a> I took today when walking through a cemetary.
