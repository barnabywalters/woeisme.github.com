So it's been a bit, let's not go through the self discovery and analysis that accompanies late blog
updates. It happen's it's known, fortunately I carry no readership except myself so it doesn't matter.
I find that often the ideas that occur for me to write about involve being away from the actual method
for writing them. That's a curious thing. Another curious thing has caught my attention recently. The 
unmasking of some [LulzSec](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LulzSec) participants last week. Normally 
this happens and is expected in computer circles, however something struck me pretty deeply upon the
subsequent news coverage. The eventual informant (and there always is one) went by handle Sabu, he was
approached by fbi agents and coerced into building cases against the other members. Nothing suprising there. 
Here's what DID strike me, according to the [Times article](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/09/technology/hacker-informant-and-party-boy-of-the-projects.html?_r=1) what eventually got him to co-operate
was his desire to protect his children. The underlying idea being, if he did not his children would be thrown to CPS and the foster care system. end stop. 
Doesn't that strike anyone else as particularly messed up? Fbi agents well aware of how bad and damaging the foster system could be using that as a threat to induce co-operation?
Anyhow thats just food for thought.
