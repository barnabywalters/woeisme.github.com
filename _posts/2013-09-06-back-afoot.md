Wow! it's been a bit no? I finally sat down tonight to fix my blog that I originally started when I moved to Iceland. It's been roughly 1.8 years since I've moved
to Reykjavik. I couldn't have imagined what would has transpired in the last year if I was forced to guess. I worked for [Videntifier](http://www.videntifier.com])for
about a year before getting fired. During that year I decided that Iceland needed to form a political front to realize the full economic, social and cultural potential
that lay dormant here. To that end I started a series of meetings at [HR](http://hr.is) in July of 2012 that lead eventually to forming the 
[Icelandic Pirate Party](http://piratar.is). I gave a brief [talk](http://youtu.be/3V4G5ANbjmk?t=2h21m34s) at [CCC](http://ccc.de) in Hamburg, Germany 
about many of the pieces in play here in Iceland. Recently I was hired (and then fired) from [Greenqloud](http://www.greenqloud.com) another interesting startup
here in Iceland. Close friends of mine have launched a super successful indiegogo campaign around secure self hosted email called [Mailpile](http://www.mailpile.is).
I'm pleased to finally resume updating this blog, lets see if it keeps happening.
